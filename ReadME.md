This Go code is designed to analyze data from CSV files and produce summarized results based on specified operations. It supports both one-dimensional and two-dimensional analyses, enabling users to perform various data aggregation tasks such as counting unique occurrences, calculating averages, and summing numerical values. The code is structured around two main functions, **`AnalyzeOneDimensionalData`** and **`AnalyzeTwoDimensionalData`**, which handle one-dimensional and two-dimensional data analysis, respectively. Here is an overview of its functionality and usage:

### **AnalyzeOneDimensionalData Function**

- **Purpose**: Analyzes a CSV file to perform data aggregation operations on a specified column. Supported operations include counting unique occurrences, calculating averages, and summing numerical values.
- **Parameters**:
    - **`csvFile`**: A pointer to an **`os.File`** object representing the CSV file.
    - **`columnConfig`**: A struct containing configuration for the analysis, including the column to operate on, the type of operation, and any filters to apply.
- **Output**: Prints the analysis results to the console and updates the **`columnConfig`** with the result. If no data matches the criteria, it defaults to zero.
- **Error Handling**: Returns an error if issues arise, such as the specified column not found in the CSV file or parsing errors.

### **AnalyzeTwoDimensionalData Function**

- **Purpose**: Similar to **`AnalyzeOneDimensionalData`**, but allows for analysis based on two dimensions, enabling more complex data relationships to be explored.
- **Parameters**:
    - **`csvFile`**: A pointer to an **`os.File`** object representing the CSV file.
    - **`reportOutput`**: A struct that includes configuration for the analysis, such as the independent and dependent columns, filters, and the types of operations to perform on the dependent columns.
- **Output**: Prepares the analysis result in a format suitable for charting or further analysis and seeks the CSV file pointer back to the start for potential reuse.
- **Error Handling**: Returns an error for similar reasons as **`AnalyzeOneDimensionalData`**, including column not found or filter issues.

### **Helper Functions**

- **readCSVFromHandler**: Reads and returns all records from a CSV file.
- **incrementValue**, **addNumericalValue**, **addNumericalValueForAverage**: Utility functions to manipulate the aggregated data based on the operation type.
- **calculateAverages**: Calculates the average for entries that have been processed for average calculation, rounding the result to three decimal places.
- **rowPassesFilters**: Checks if a row passes the set filters.
- **processOperation**: Processes a single record based on the specified operation and updates the output map.
- **findColumnIndex**: Finds the index of a column in the CSV header.
- **convertToChartFormat**: Converts the analysis output into a format suitable for charting, ensuring data is sorted based on the independent column.
- **sortData**: Sorts a slice of maps based on a specified sort key.

### **Usage Notes**

- The code is structured to be modular and reusable for various types of data analysis tasks within CSV files.
- It leverages Go's strong typing, error handling, and map manipulation features to perform data analysis efficiently.
- To use this code, one must define the appropriate structures (**`models.ReportCSVData`**, **`models.ReportOneDimConfig`**, **`models.ReportChartOutput`**) according to the specific needs of the analysis, including specifying columns for analysis, the type of operation, and any filters to apply.
